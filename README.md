# SDL Physics Simulator

## Overview
This is a WIP physics simulator coded using only C and the SDL2 library for graphics handling. It currently uses the Stormer-Verlet equations to handle it's physics but I plan to improve the accuracty of the engine by using more complex models in the future. Currently, the functionality is limited to the creation of rigidbody circles and stationary obstacles.

## Future Plans
- Improved Physics Engine
- User Defined Shapes
- Simulation of pressurized objects using springs
- Interactable Ropes
